without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License
shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade
secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated
herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell
embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in
Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks
are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted
to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any
Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source
Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by
Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of
this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and
patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence,
the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT
WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the
warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license
to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to
the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this
exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a
Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or
to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do
so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between
Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent
laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising
any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your
acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and
You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of
the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against
Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This
termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement
by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor
resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of
that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this
License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and
penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. ยง 101 et seq., the equivalent laws
of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the
termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking
damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such
action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities,
"You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common
control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power,
direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether
by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to
interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on

Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
    this License; and

  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    You changed the files; and

  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of the Derivative Works; and

  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not
provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public
licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons
makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis.
Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material
licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative
Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
fullest extent possible.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they
choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary
before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license.
This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or
limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for
example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that
use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under
copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including
because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may
make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those
requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor
grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that
is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed
Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in
a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a
musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always
produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving
image.

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar
Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound
recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are
labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified
in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under
Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or
similar international agreements.

e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar
Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has
authority to license.

h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996
on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as
other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this
Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and
Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not
need to comply with its terms and conditions.

3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You
from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications
authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.

5. Downstream recipients.

A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed
Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed
as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed
Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to
allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to
collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

a. Attribution.

1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

ii. a copyright notice;

iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;

B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any
previous modifications; and

C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and
include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.
For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required
by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your
obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other
Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may
not apply to You.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any
legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any
direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or
other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or
use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall
be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your
rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at
any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining
terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to
comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative
Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes
and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” Except for the limited
purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public
license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at
creativecommons.org/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the
trademark “Creative Commons” or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons
without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection
with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other
arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.
For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph does not form part of the public
licenses.

Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal
==================================


Creative Commons Legal Code
---------------------------


CC0 1.0 Universal
-----------------

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
HEREUNDER.


Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected
by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
    and translate a Work;

  ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
    depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject
    to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
    Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work

  i.  in all territories worldwide,

  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions),

  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and

  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").

Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large
and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall
be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable,
non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work

  i.  in all territories worldwide,

  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions),

  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and

  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "License").

The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer
to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such
case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not

  i.  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work or

  ii.  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
    Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of
    any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
    including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
    may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
    person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
    other rights required for any use of the Work.

Python Software Foundation License 2.0
(argparse 2.0.1)

This license was approved as the official PSF License Version 2 on October 22,
2004. The only differences between this and version 1 of the PSF license consist
of removing Python version numbers (like 2.1.1 or 2.3).



PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION LICENSE VERSION 2
============================================

--------------------------------------------

  1.  This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"),
    and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using
    this software ("Python") in source or binary form and its associated
    documentation.

  2.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
    grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to
    reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative
    works, distribute, and otherwise use Python alone or in any derivative
    version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of
    copyright, i.e., "Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 Python Software
    Foundation; All Rights Reserved" are retained in Python alone or in any
    derivative version prepared by Licensee.

  3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
    incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make the derivative
    work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby agrees to
    include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python.

  4.  PSF is making Python available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis. PSF MAKES
    NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT
    NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF
    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF
    PYTHON WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

  5.  PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON FOR ANY
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
    MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
    THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

  6.  This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach
    of its terms and conditions.

  7.  Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any
    relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and
    Licensee. This License Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF
    trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products
    or services of Licensee, or any third party.

  8.  By copying, installing or otherwise using Python, Licensee agrees to be
    bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
